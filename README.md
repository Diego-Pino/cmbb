# cmBB
A simple yet powerful content management system for phpBB

This CMS is an "Add-on" for the popular phpBB3 forum system. It therefore requires a phpBB installation to work.

# Install
  1. Make sure you have a phpBB (3.2) install setup in a subfolder of your webroot (e.g. ./htdocs/phpBB3)
  2. Download the source files
  3. If your phpBB installation is in a folder other than "phpBB3", rename the "phpBB3" folder in the CMBB source files to match your forum path
  4. Upload the CMBB source files
  5. Make sure you are logged in as an administrator
  6. Go to the CMBB index page and follow instructions

# Please note
* CMBB is in very early stage of development. I intent to convert this into an approved extension for phpBB but of course that will take time. I have a fulltime job and a private busy life as well.
* This is only tested with phpBB 3.2.RC1 and MySQL so far. phpBB 3.1 might work, but if it doesn't, tough luck. Any other DBMS but MySQL will most certainly fail.
