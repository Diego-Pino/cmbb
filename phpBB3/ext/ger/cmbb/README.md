# cmBB
A simple yet powerful content management system for phpBB

This CMS is an "Add-on" for the popular phpBB3 forum system. It therefore requires a phpBB installation to work.

## Installation

Copy the extension to phpBB/ext/ger/cmbb

Go to "ACP" > "Customise" > "Extensions" and enable the "cmBB" extension.

## Tests and Continuous Integration

We use Travis-CI as a continuous integration server and phpunit for our unit testing. See more information on the [phpBB development wiki](https://wiki.phpbb.com/Unit_Tests).
To run the tests locally, you need to install phpBB from its Git repository. Afterwards run the following command from the phpBB Git repository's root:

Windows:

    phpBB\vendor\bin\phpunit.bat -c phpBB\ext\ger\cmbb\phpunit.xml.dist

others:

    phpBB/vendor/bin/phpunit -c phpBB/ext/ger/cmbb/phpunit.xml.dist
